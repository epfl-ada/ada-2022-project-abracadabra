# Introduction

Do gaming YouTubers have a political lean? To answer this question, we analyzed the shared viewerbase between gaming and news/politics YouTube channels to see if there is a link between the two. By doing this, we can gain insight into the political leanings of gaming YouTubers and then see if specific games attract certain types of political opinions.

Because gaming creators are often watched by younger audiences, it is important to consider if they have any political leanings, as they can have a large influence on their viewers. If we were to find any link, this project would be important in order to inform viewers on potential bias in the content they are consuming.

## Important assumptions
As our dataset doesn't contain any information about viewers, we assume that the commenter-base of a video is statistically representative of its viewerbase. This is clearly not the case, because people who watch every video from a certain content creator would probably have more of a tendency to write comments on their videos, but this assumption needs to be done to get any kind of analysis done.

Furthermore, the comments dataset does not contain any information on the comment's text. So we also need to assume that all comments enjoyed or are in agreement with the video. Again, this is a questionable assumption, as hate comments are a notoriously common experience for any Youtuber.

Because the dataset is huge, we only considered the comments from the top 200 most subscribed gaming channels as well as the top 200 news/politics channels.
