# Conclusion

In this data story, we managed to find meaningful groupings of news outlets. We did so by linking news outlets together by the individuals they cite. These groups were represented visually in interesting and meaningful ways.

We were able to identify what defines each group based on closer inspection of the most quoted speakers, the top journals, quote semantics and keyword analysis.

This gave useful insights into the relationships between news outlets. We saw how news outlets are strongly geographically linked, how the US and its major politicians influence news worldwide, and how the current Coronavirus pandemic predominates news topics.

As further work, we could use the methods developed for this project to automatically classify news outlets based only on their citations. Additonally, by looking at which groups mention a given topic or individual, we could provide a more granular insight into it is treated in the news.
