            Do gaming YouTubers have a political lean? To answer this question, we analysed the shared viewerbase between
gaming and news/politics YouTube channels to see if there is a link between the two. By doing this, we can gain insight
into the political leanings of gaming YouTubers and then see if specific games attract certain types of political opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because gaming creators are often watched by younger audiences, it is important to consider if they have any
political leanings, as they can have a large influence on their viewers. If we were to find any link, this project would
be important in order to inform viewers on potential bias in the content they are consuming.
        </p>
        &nbsp;
        <h4 class="section-heading">Important assumptions</h4>
        <p>
            As our dataset doesn't contain any information about viewers, we assume that the commenter-base of a video 
is statistically representative of its viewerbase. This is clearly not the case, because people who watch every video 
from a certain content creator would probably have more of a tendency to write comments on their videos, but this assumption
needs to be done to get any kind of analysis done.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, the comments dataset does not contain any information on the comment's text. So we also need
to assume that all comments enjoyed or are in agreement with the video. Again, this is a questionable assumption, as 
hate comments are a notoriously common experience for any Youtuber.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because the dataset is very big, we only considered the comments from the top 200 most subscribed gaming 
channels as well as the top 200 news/politics channels.

<h4 class="section-heading">Trying to find similar channels</h4>

<p>
Our first intuition was to take the aforementioned gaming and political channels and to find groups of YouTubers with
similar commenters, regardless of the channel type. By doing this, if we found clusters containing both news/politics
and gaming channels, we might have already found what we were looking for, as it would mean that some gaming YouTubers
shared more viewers with some news or politics channels than to other gaming creators.
</p>
<p>
To do this, we looked at every commenter who left a comment on videos created by at least two of these channels. We
then created a 400 by 400 matrix called the similarity matrix (depicted below). Each element of this matrix represents
the number of commenters that left a comment on both channels. For example, the first row and column of the matrix 
represents PlayStation's shared commenters with every other channel. PewDiePie is represented by the fourth row and column,
so if we look at the fourth element of the first row (or the first element of the first column), we will find how many 
people commented on both channels.
</p>
<figure>

    <div align="center" >Fig. 1 - Similarity matrix</div>
</figure>
&nbsp;
<p>
To get a more meaningful measure of similarity, we divided the number of common commenters by the average number of 
comments left on both channels. This normalization is important as it gives a proportion of shared commenters instead 
of just a number. This takes takes care of problems having to do with the biggest channel dominating our measures.
</p>
<p>
The normalized similarity matrix is thus given below :
</p>

<figure>
    <img alt="Normalized Similarity Matrix" src="{{ "/img/norm_sim_mat_400.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width:60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto">
    <div align="center" >Fig. 2 - Normalized Similarity Matrix</div>
</figure>
&nbsp;
<p>
As we can see, the matrix isn't dominated by particular channels. But rather there are specific connections between 
channels that pop out.
</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, we find that 5 of the channels do not share commenters with any of the other channels. We did not expect
this, as these are some of the most popular channels on YouTube. We thought that any of them would have a common 
commenter with at least one of the others. 
</p>
<p>
Let's look at theses disconnected channels :
</p>

<figure>
    <img alt="Disconnected channels" src="{{ "/img/disconnected_channels.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width:60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto">
    <div align="center" >Fig. 3 - Disconnected channels</div>
</figure>
&nbsp;

<p>
Weird, these seem like popular channels, there should at least be some crossover in viewership with some of the other
channels. Have we discovered a subscriber-bot scandal ?
</p>
<p>
After taking a look at these channels on YouTube, we came up to these simple explanations for 4 of these 5 channels :
    <ul>
        <li><p>Mastersaint, Jonni Valentayn and ABC News (Australia) have their comments turned off</p></li>
        <li><p>SOMOY TV is a Bangladeshi television broadcast, so we assumed their viewers might not speak English and 
are not the most likely audience to watch and comment on other non-Bangladeshi videos</p></li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
British Path√© is more difficult to explain. This channel publishes archives from 1910 to 1984.  Their videos are in
English and consistently get comments. Because the subject matter is quite niche, there might just not be any natural 
crossover in commenters as none of the other channels work with this type of content.
</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Visualizing the clusters</h4>
<p>
Using the above normalized similarity matrix, we ran a spectral clustering algorithm which gave us 2 groups of channels.
We then made a force-based connection network to visualize our channels, using the similarity between two channels as
the weight of their common edge. Finally, we colored the nodes based on the clusters computed by our algorithm.
</p>
<p>
As you can see below, the network makes two clear groups, which mostly correspond to the computed clusters.
</p>

<figure>

    <iframe style="width:90%;height:700px;" src="https://alpopesc.github.io/ADA_graph_1_2_cluster/" title="ADA_graph_1_2_cluster"></iframe>
</p>

<p>
At first, we thought it separated the channels into gaming and news/politics content, as most nodes in the left cluster
are news channels, and most of the others are gaming.
</p>

<p>
However, there is a much better explanation for the way these groups formed.
</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Oh yeah, countries exist</h4>
<p>
If you look at the actual channels that are in the left cluster, all of them are news channels from India and Pakistan.
Obviously, people will tend to watch news that is the most relevant to them.
</p>
<p>
We thought this type of problem wouldn't arise as our dataset should only contain English speaking YouTubers. 
Unfortunately for us, a lot of popular news channels are either bilingual, or are just misclassified.
</p>
<p>
What tripped us at first was that the clusters look a lot like the gaming and news/politics divide. This is actually 
just because there are a lot more gaming channels than news channels, and they are for the most part English speaking. 
For the news channels, there tends to be only a few per country and their number tends to grow with the size of the 
population. This means that the top 200 most subscribed news/politics channels is dominated by countries with a lot 
of people, such as India and Pakistan.
</p>
<p>
Because we still wanted to find out if gaming YouTubers have a political lean, and that most of the top 200 speak 
English, we needed to filter these non-English channels out. We did not find any good way of doing this before the
clustering, as some videos have English titles and descriptions, but speak in another language. Therefore we decided 
to use our clusters to filter them out, and restart the process with only the right cluster. We also made sure to
filter out the disconnected channels.
</p>

<h4 class="section-heading">Recursive clustering</h4>
<p>
Once these channels were filtered out, we recomputed a new normalised similarity matrix and separated the channels into
two clusters. Again, we found one big cluster of English-speaking channels and one cluster with
just 3 Kenyan news channels.
</p>

<figure>
    <img alt="Kenyan news channels cluster" src="{{ "/img/kenyan_cluster.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width:60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto">
    <div align="center" >Fig. 4 - Kenyan news channels cluster</div>
</figure>
<p>
At this point, we were quite annoyed, as we thought we might have to go through every country, but as long as we
continued recursively clustering and filtering out non-English channels, we would eventually find what 
we were looking for.
</p>
<p>
Luckily, we didn't have to. We were left with 2 clusters, here are their statistics :
</p>
<figure>
    <img alt="Cluster statistics" src="{{ "/img/stats_gaming_politics_clusters.PNG" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="width:60%; display: block; margin: 0 auto">
    <div align="center" >Fig. 5 - Cluster statistics</div>
</figure>
<p>
As we can see, one cluster is clearly has more news/politics channels, and the other corresponds to gaming YouTubers.
This means that overall, people that comment on news/politics videos tend not to comment as much on gaming 
videos and vice versa.
</p>

</p>


<h4 class="section-heading">Classifying the news/politics channels</h4>
<p>
If there isn't any inherent crossover in commenters, we can still try and find some type of political bias for gaming
YouTubers by first classifying the news/politics channels on a political axis, and then look at their commenters
to see what gaming channels they like to watch.
</p>
<p>
To do this, we took the filtered channels computed previously and only kept the news/political channels. We now have
channels that are English-speaking, and only talk about news and/or politics.
</p>
<p>
Then, we applied the same clustering method by looking at their common commenters, making a similarity matrix and 
running a spectral clustering algorithm. To allow for some nuance, we decided to cluster into 4 groups.
</p>
<p>
Here is the resulting network : 
</p>

<p align="center">
    <iframe style="width:90%;height:700px;" src="https://alpopesc.github.io/politics_4/network/" title="politics_4_network"></iframe>
</p>


<p>
The first two clusters are not very useful. One of them only has one channel, which is John Legends 
(a mislabelled music channel). The other group contains 2 channels, but they are both owned by GMA 
(Good Morning America), so their similarity is obviously going to be high.
</p>
<p>
For the two others, although they contain quite a lot of channels, we cannot think of any kind of reason as to what 
they represent. For example, looking at American politics, notoriously republican channels such as Ben Shapiro and 
Fox News are in the same cluster as CNN or MSNBC, who are usually more pro-democrats. We thought it might still 
separate based on geography, but in both clusters, a variety of different regions are represented.
</p>
<p>
This would mean that people don't tend to comment on videos that always have the same political opinions. This also 
means that we cannot prove anything about the political lean of gaming YouTubers.

</div>
<p>
We therefore conclude that, under our questionable assumptions, there is no significant crossover in viewership between
gaming YouTubers and news/politics channels. This is probably due to a difference in age demographics, as children
and adolescents probably don't care as much about news and politics compared to their favorite video game.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, we weren't able to classify commenters into any kind of political affiliation.
</p>
<p>
Having access to the viewership data would probably have revealed a lot more about the situation, but based on our 
analysis, gaming communities are not tied to any kind of political bias.
